## Background

We have competed in intramural sports for years and have always had to scramble to find replacement players when teammates cannot make it. We have resorted to mass texting our network and many times have been unsuccessful. Our app solves this problem by making it easy to find replacement players who are eager to compete!

Our mission: Eradicate forfeiting due to lack of players in attendance

## Features

- Create a User profile
- Ability to browse Game Postings as a Free Agent
- Create your team and add your teammates on the roster
- Join an existing team with the Team ID provided by your team captain
- Manage your attendance by automatically posting to the board whenever a user cannot attend your game

## Usage

- Go to ISN.com (not secured yet) and register as a user. 
- If you are creating a team from scratch, select the "Create a Team" option in the registration process
- If you have a TEAM ID from your captain, input it during the registration process to be added to the team
- If you do not wish to join a team, simply browse the Posts board as a Free Agent
- If you'd like to fill an open slot, click the "Join This Team" option on the Post page

## Development/Contribution

If you'd like to improve our app, please fork this repo and submit a pull request! :)

## Future

In the future, we'd like this application to be a fully functioning intramural management tool. If it can become useful enough, we can integrate it with intramural leagues worldwide as a means to manage attendance. 

- Review system to review teams and players after games (i.e. "Player was a ball hog", "Team never let me play")
- Ability for Free Agents to put up posts to indicate interest in playing so teams can seek them out
- Seamless interface so scheduling controls can all happen from a single screen
- Styling touch-ups
